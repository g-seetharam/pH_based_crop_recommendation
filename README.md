# pH_based_crop_recommendation
This is a DTI Project to solve the issues of farmers, this project aims to suggest the crops based on the land pH value and also give remedies to acheive a good pH value for that specific land.
This DTI Project was done in my 2nd year of BTech i.e. in the academic year 2022-2023
